OMG, dude, I just finished watching The Amateur, and I've got sooo many thoughts bouncing around my brain right now. Like, first of all, why did no one warn me about how intense that movie was gonna be?!? I’m seriously still catching my breath, hahaha! I mean, I kinda knew it would be wild, but not CRAZY wild, you know what I mean?

Okay, so the plot was this whole mystery thrill-ride, but I gotta admit, parts of it made zero sense to me. Like the main character just picking locks like he's in some video game. I’m sitting there like, “Sure, bud, that’s how real life works,” LOL. But then again, that’s what makes it so thrilling, right? Just when you think you've got it figured out, BOOM, plot twist! Honestly, I should've just downloaded the movie ages ago.

> And the cinematography? WOWZA! The way they shot the night scenes, with all those shadows and stuff? Totally nailed the atmosphere. I don't think I've seen a movie that captures tension like that in a long time. But seriously, why do they always make the protagonist some frustratingly flawed genius? It's like, we get it, he's brilliant but a hot mess.

Oh!! And the soundtrack. Absolute banger! Tbh, it had me swaying more than a few times. I might even watch the movie again just to catch the beats I missed 'cause I was too busy yelling at the screeeeeeeen! Hahaha, you do that too, right? It's kinda like an interactive workout, more cardio the better. 😜

Sometimes I wonder if these directors just throw darts at a wall of ideas, fame still eludes me hahaha, but there’s something oddly comforting about how the chaos eventually ties together. Except for that one subplot, like seriously, what even was that?! Did I miss something while I was grabbing snacks, or was it just THERE for no reason??

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Debug.Log(Why did I type this?); }

But hey, at least it got me through a rainy night without losing my mind. Anyway, let’s catch up soon! We gotta pick another film and do this all over again. Curious to hear what you think if you saw it too, so hit me up, yeah? Peace out! 🤘
